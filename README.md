## Ricky and Morty App

A full-stack application for managing and generating character backstories. Built with Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

> The app currently doesnt have all required features. i didnt have much time to work on it, especially that i don't have experince nor am i familiar with some of the technologies. it's not the most impressive in terms of features but i think it is decent enough to assess. i will share my thoughts on missing features and how i would implement them,as well as what parts of the app might need improvments.

### üöÄ Features

### üìù Potential Optimizations

- **React Context**: Switch from Zustand to React Context for state management, particularly for the auth part, as Zustand is currently only used for this and is overkill (I initially chose it planning to implement all features).

- **Caching**: Implement caching to store frequently accessed character info and backstories from external APIs.

- **RAG Implementation**: Instead of fine-tuning models for the chatting feature, explore using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide more relevant responses.

- **Cost-Efficient AI APIs**: Consider using Gemini or other alternative AI APIs to reduce costs, as OpenAI‚Äôs API can become expensive.

- **Lazy Loading for Images**.

- **Web workers & Web servers**.
